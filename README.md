# LangPractice

This project is my attempt to build a scalable and efficient server using **Java** and the **Spring Boot Framework**. With experience gathered from previous projects, I was able to better leverage modern technologies to build this application from the ground up, focusing on core features and maintainable architecture.

## 📚 About LangPractice

**LangPractice** is tailored for daily language practice, built around my own learning method:

- **Create Packs**: Users create packs with custom content, each containing a list of questions (with question and answer texts).
- **Play a Pack**: For each question, users practice translating the text, combining reading, speaking, and writing exercises.
- **Track Progress**: After completing a pack, a history record is added to help users monitor their learning progress over time.
- **Pack Sharing**: Users can publish their packs so that others can learn from them.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Framework**: Spring Boot, Java
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Full-text Search, JSONB columns)
- **ORM & Migration**: Hibernate (Data Projection, Custom Queries, L2 Cache), Flyway
- **Authentication**: Spring Security with JWT Authentication
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
